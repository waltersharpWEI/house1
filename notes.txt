rnn has problem
the result is very different from the start
it could be a problem on MinMaxScalar and Reshape during 
the Preprocessing

1.RNN doens't converge as it was
It seems not the problem of the version
could be a tensorflow or python(2,3) problem

2 When switched to python2
it works normally then

Next steps:
1. croos_entorpy or other loss function
2. stacked deep lstm
3. data handle
4. handle of different area
5. new target (a upward or downward trend, how severe the trend is)
